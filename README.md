php-mvc-skeleton
================

This is a very simple MVC skeleton for PHP.

It is the result of years of constant adaptation of the structure of the PHP projects I have worked at. It has been used in several projects that needed very good performance, high security standards, and a lot of customization, for which a full-featured MVC platform would be too cumbersome to use.
