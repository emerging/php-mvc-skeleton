php-mvc-skeleton
================

This is a very simple MVC skeleton for PHP.

It is the result of years of constant adaptation of the structure of the PHP
projects I have worked at. It has been used in several projects that needed very
good performance, high security standards, and a lot of customization, for which
a full-featured MVC platform would be too cumbersome to use.

Models are in lib->classes
Views are in templates (Smarty)
Controllers are in www, and are directly accessible

THIS IS YET AN INCOMPLETE PROJECT, IT LACKS A REAL EXAMPLE WITH VIEWS
